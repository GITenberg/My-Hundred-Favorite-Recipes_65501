<div class="img">

</div>
<p>No matter how old a story cooking is to us, no matter how little zest we think
we have for it, we need only to have a new recipe, a new ingredient or a new
method in cookery held tantalizingly before us to discover that our interest
hasn&rsquo;t waned after all. For the quest of the new and better in cookery never loses
its allure.</p>
<h3 id="c2"><i>Even Milk has New Secrets to Reveal</i></h3>
<p>Milk, perhaps more than anything else, seems to hold no novelty for us. Yet we
recognize in it our most important food, supplying all the elements needed for
health and growth. We know that doctors and dietitians insist upon a quart of
milk a day for each member of the family. And we know that the simplest way to
provide this milk is through its generous use in cooking, thereby supplying it in
such a variety of form that no one tires of it.</p>
<p>It is therefore extremely interesting to discover that milk can contribute to our
cookery a deliciousness of flavor, a smoothness of texture, a richness, a dependability
of result and an economy of other materials that we have never experienced
if we have confined our use of milk to ordinary bottled milk.</p>
<p>Only a milk of uniformly high quality and richness can produce such cooking
results. To secure this uniformly high quality and richness many thousands of
women have turned to a form of milk that adds immeasurably to the success of
cookery&mdash;Carnation Evaporated Milk.</p>
<h3 id="c3"><i>What Carnation Milk IS</i></h3>
<p>Carnation Milk is simply the purest of rich whole milk, from fine herds,
evaporated to double richness, &ldquo;homogenized,&rdquo; and sterilized for safe keeping. To
insure the quality and purity of this milk, the Carnation Company maintains at the
famous Carnation Milk Farms two of the largest herds of pure bred Holsteins in
the world&mdash;among them the world&rsquo;s greatest milk and butter producers&mdash;and
introduces this high milk producing strain into the many herds of &ldquo;Contented
Cows&rdquo; from which the milk for the Carnation condenseries is obtained. Carnation
field men constantly supervise these herds to insure the proper care and feeding of
the cows, and the cleanliness of the surroundings and milking methods.</p>
<p>It is this better milk&mdash;rushed to the Carnation condenseries in sterilized cans,
tested and retested for purity and richness, evaporated to double richness, &ldquo;homogenized&rdquo;
to break up the cream globules into minute particles and keep them
uniformly distributed all through the milk, sealed in clean, air-tight cans and
sterilized&mdash;that you get in every can of Carnation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Nothing is added to it; nothing taken out except sixty per cent of the water
(milk is eighty-seven per cent water as it comes from the cow). Perfect sterilization
gives it a rich creamy color and insures its staying sweet and pure indefinitely.</p>
<h3 id="c4"><i>What Carnation Milk DOES</i></h3>
<p>Being doubly rich because of evaporation, Carnation Milk gives to every dish in
which it is used the benefit of its double creaminess. Naturally, when you use
Carnation in its concentrated form, you save decidedly on butter and cream.</p>
<p>Being always pure and sweet, never varying in richness and high quality
Carnation gives <i>uniformly dependable</i> results in cookery. Being &ldquo;homogenized,&rdquo;
Carnation Milk with its unusually fine and evenly distributed cream particles
gives a creaminess, a velvety smoothness, a fine texture, that even the finest of
bottled milk cannot equal. Soups and sauces, candies and cakes, ice creams,
custards, puddings, waffles and griddle cakes are among the many dishes to which
Carnation gives this notably smooth, delicate texture.</p>
<p>Among home economics experts Carnation Milk has an extremely wide acceptance.
These women, to whom cooking is both a science and an art, choose Carnation
not only for the definitely improved quality which it gives to so many dishes,
but because its convenient and dependable form and its freedom from waste, are in
keeping with modern standards of efficiency in the kitchen.</p>
<h3 id="c5"><i>Carnation as a Baby Food</i></h3>
<p>Our best baby food, of course, is mother&rsquo;s milk. But if a baby can not have
mother&rsquo;s milk, then Carnation is recommended, modified according to the physician&rsquo;s
directions. The tiny butter fat globules, evenly distributed, make Carnation
Milk easy for the baby to digest. Then too, because of the heat of sterilization, the
curd formed in the stomach is softer and more easily digested than that formed by
raw milk.</p>
<p>You can get Carnation anywhere, take it anywhere, with the utmost confidence
that the milk&rsquo;s purity and controlled uniformity will protect the baby from upsets
so often caused by milk of changing and uncertain quality. If you would like more
information about Carnation for baby feeding, I will gladly send you one of our
interesting folders, which deals with this subject.</p>
<h3 id="c6"><i>Now Try Carnation</i></h3>
<p>The recipes which follow have been perfected in our own kitchen, to insure your
obtaining the superior results which the quality of Carnation Milk makes possible.</p>
<p>Order Carnation today from your grocer and prepare to enjoy &ldquo;the delight of
the <i>new</i> in cookery.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">GENERAL DIRECTION</span></h2>
<h3 id="c8"><i>Making Accurate Measurements</i></h3>
<p>In order to insure perfect results measurements should be accurately
made and directions carefully followed. Use standard
measuring cups and spoons and make all measurements absolutely
level. In order to do this fill the cup or spoon and then level with a
knife. Half, quarter, and third cupfuls are indicated by marks on
the cup. To measure a half spoonful, fill the spoon, level, and
then divide lengthwise. To measure a quarter spoonful divide
the halves crosswise.</p>
<p>Flour should always be sifted once before measuring.</p>
<p>In measuring butter and other solid fats, pack solidly. When
the recipe calls for a certain amount of butter melted, measure
before melting. When it calls for melted butter, measure after
melting.</p>

<h3 id="c10"><i>Precautions to be Observed in Heating Milk</i></h3>
<p>Since milk scorches very easily it is advisable to heat it in a
double boiler. If heated directly over the fire the heat should be
low or an asbestos mat should be placed under the pan. If a
double boiler is not used the milk requires careful watching and
stirring to prevent scorching.</p>
<h3 id="c11"><i>The Use of Carnation as Cream or Milk</i></h3>
<p>If you wish to use Carnation in place of cream, use it undiluted.
Used as milk, dilute it with an equal amount of water. Use half
Carnation and half water in any recipe calling for milk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><i>Soups</i></span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" id="ncfig4" alt="Soups" width="500" height="251" />
</div>
<p>Cream soups make a delightful addition to the diet and provide a splendid way to
include more milk. They also are an excellent means of using left over vegetables,
vegetable water, and the liquid from canned vegetables. Cream soups not only
stimulate the appetite, causing the digestive juices to flow more freely, but also
are very nutritious. Because Carnation Milk is rich and creamy it is the secret of
the creaminess of these soups.</p>
<h3 id="c13"><i>Garnishes for Cream Soups</i></h3>
<p>What a magic effect a little garnishing has and how easily it converts a simple dish
of soup into one that is deliciously attractive! The following garnishes are all
suitable for cream soups:</p>
<div class="verse">

<p>Heat the milk and the tomato soup in different pans but at the same time, watching
carefully to prevent scorching. When both are piping hot (not boiling) and you are
ready to serve, pour the hot tomato into the hot Carnation and serve immediately.
To avoid curdling be sure to pour the tomato into the milk instead of vice versa.
Do not combine the tomato and milk until ready to serve as these should be heated
separately. This makes a thick and delicious soup. Serves 4.</p>

<p class="center db">CARNATION MILK FOR CREAMING VEGETABLES</p>
<h2 id="c40"><span class="small"><i>Vegetables</i></span></h2>
<p>Serving vegetables in an attractive form is an important part of cookery because of
the value of vegetables in the diet. They add the necessary bulk, some contain
energy yielding material, some furnish tissue building material, but their greatest
value lies in their rich mineral and vitamin content, both of which are essential for
growth and for health. Doctors and dietitians advise the daily serving of at least
two vegetables besides potato, one of these to be served in the raw form, as in a salad.</p>
<p>In order to prevent loss of minerals and destruction of vitamins it is best to cook the
vegetables in the shortest time possible and in a small amount of water. Since the
water in which vegetables are cooked or canned is rich in minerals it should never
be discarded. It can be used for soups and for creaming the vegetables.</p>

<p>The secret of making a light, feathery cake of velvety smoothness lies in the selection
of materials of good quality, accurate measurements, and correct blending of
ingredients. Always sift the flour once before measuring. Carefully follow the
directions given for combining ingredients. To obtain a level cake it is well to push
the dough toward the corners of the pan before putting the cake in the oven.
When the cake is well browned, shrunken from the edge of the pan, and when
the dough springs back quickly if slightly dented in the center, the cake is done.</p>

<p>Home made pies &ldquo;like mother used to make&rdquo;! Doesn&rsquo;t that anticipation make
your mouth water? And really, pastry making is not such a difficult culinary task
if the following precautions are observed.</p>
<p>Keep all ingredients as cold as possible. If the fat is rubbed into the flour with the
fingers, use quick and light motion for if the fat is melted the crust will be tough.
Use the minimum amount of water needed to hold the dough together. Chilling
the dough before rolling makes it easier to handle and also lighter. Roll just
enough dough for one crust at a time. Use quick light motion, from the center
outward so as to keep the shape round.</p>
<p>Do not grease the pie tin. Fit dough smoothly to pie tin so no air is enclosed. If crust
is to be baked before the filling is added, the pie tin may be inverted and the dough
fitted on the outside. Handle dough as little as possible. Bake in hot oven (450&deg;F).</p>

two parts and roll out to &#8539; inch thickness on a slightly floured board. Line pie
tin, crimp edge with thumb and finger; prick sides and bottom with fork to preserve
the shape. Bake in a hot oven (450&deg;F) for 12 to 20 minutes. For a two crust pie,
line the pie tin with pastry, moisten rim with cold water, add filling and cover
with top crust which has incisions cut in it to allow the escape of steam. Press
edges of upper and lower dough together, trim off excess and bake in a hot oven
(450&deg;F). This recipe makes 2 crusts.</p>

<p class="center db">CARNATION MILK FOR CREAMY CANDIES</p>
<h2 id="c108"><span class="small"><i>Candies</i></span></h2>
<p>The candy maker who aspires to make smooth, creamy candy may be interested in
trying the following suggestions:</p>
<p>Use Carnation Milk because it is so rich and creamy. Carnation makes especially
delicious candy because of its homogenization. In this process the butter fat
particles are finely divided and evenly distributed. For this reason Carnation
blends thoroughly with the other ingredients and makes an unusually smooth
and creamy candy.</p>
<p>Use corn syrup or cream of tartar as these help to keep the candy from becoming
grainy.</p>
<p>While the candy is cooking stir just enough to prevent scorching. Too much stirring
is liable to make the candy grainy.</p>
<p>After the candy is cooked let it stand until it is almost cold. Then beat vigorously
until it is thick and creamy.</p>

from fire and let stand until cool. When cool add vanilla and beat until creamy;
add chopped nuts and mold on a buttered plate. FUDGE BALLS may be made
by forming the candy into balls and rolling in chopped nuts, cocoanut, grated
chocolate, or dipping in melted chocolate. MARSHMALLOW FUDGE may
be made by adding 1 cup of cut marshmallows instead of the nuts.</p>

oyster fork, soup spoon, and knives in the
order they are to be used, the one first used
farthest from the plate. At the left of the
plate lay the forks in the order used, the one
farthest from the plate to be used first. Always
have the tines of the forks and the bowls of the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
